Theses scripts are not usable without a specific context

FOR TIME SCRIPTS:
perf_compute takes means file in ~/client_perf and computes all "means_x_srv" files
post_mean take a number of client and a directory and select all line of mean_n_srv files in the directory which matches with the number of servers
min_compute takes a file and find the min value
all display_* scripts compute "means_x_srv" to generate gnuplot curves

FOR LOAD SCRIPTS:
load_to_csv.sh concatenate all load* files in a same server_load.csv file and launch load_to_percentage.py with it
load_to_percentage.py takes server_load file and create a results.csv file with the percentage of load for each server
all display_* scripts compute results.csv file to generate gnuplot curve
